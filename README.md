## Project Overview

This project was built by a full-stack team of 4 back-end and 3 front-end developers at the Turing School of Software and Design. Initially our plan was to make "Dude, How's My Car", a car maintenance tracker, but we discovered limitations early in the planning phase regarding the API's available to us and shifted to creating a cost-of-living comparison tool. In this application, a user can search through over 250 international cities, see dedicated information about that city such as housing, leisure, salaries and more, and compare it to another city side-by-side. The user also has the ability to favorite and unfavorite cities. 

## Learning Goals

* Collaborate and coordinate with a full-stack team
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow
* Use continuous integration to build and automate the deployment of features

## Technologies and Tools

* React and React Libraries (Hooks, Bootstrap, Styled Components)
* JavaScript
* JSX
* CircleCI
* Cypress
* NPM
* Webpack

## Project Reflections

### Wins

 * Successfully communicated between two teams to coordinate endpoints and delivery of data
 * Adherence to agile methodology through daily stand-ups and retrospectives
 * Learning and implementing new technologies such as CircleCI, new React Libraries and DjangoDB
 * Implementation of mobile first design and reaching a high degree of responsiveness
 * Conflict resolution

## Roadmap

Future features could include:

* Improved display of progress bars
* Ability to compare more than two cities at once
* Implement more features of Progressive Web Applications such as the ability to download the application
* Add more data to allow a user to more meaningfully interact with a certain city, such as job sites and housing portals
* Moving the back-end server away from Heroku

## Setup
1. Fork and clone down this repository
2. Cd into the root directory and run `npm install`
3. To run the server, run `npm start` in the terminal. To stop the local server, use command `Control + C`.
4. The server should direct you to http://localhost:3000, but if not, visit http://localhost:3000
5. Use the app!
